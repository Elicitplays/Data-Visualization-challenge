# Data-Visualization-challenge
Overall a rough one ngl. This was hard mostly because of some unclear instructions especially within the outliers section. Otherwise not the worst, was nice to see the applications in a medical trial which was cool.
Copy of analysis:
Through analysis of these trials one can say that Capomulin and Ramicane had the some of the most effective results when it came to treating tumors within mice. There was a sample size of 248 mice with the drugs being Capomulin,Ramicane, Ketapril, Naftisol, Zoniferol, Stelasyn, a Placebo,Infubinol, Ceftamin, and Propriva. The trials were measured in 5 day intervals keeping into account weight, the tumor volume, and their age. When it came to the testing we found that the Capomulin and Ramicane to be the more effective drug. The mice who had the Propiva drug actually died faster with the tumor than even the mice who received no treatment(Placebo). Capomulin has been showing on average a more substantial decrease in tumor volume in the rats that received the treatment. There is also a very strong positive correlation between Average tumor volume and weight which makes sense because the tumor volume also adds weight to the mouse.
